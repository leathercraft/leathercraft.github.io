Wei Feng network on March 11, in the solar system, each planet has its own style and character. But it almost certainly is, other than Earth, and other planets are not--for life, of course, other asteroids and Mars may have had. Even so, we were not fully aware of all planets of the solar system. In contrast, most limited human understanding is conveniently located in the outer solar system, Uranus and Neptune. Humans the true meaning of close distance between the two planets, only a year when Voyager second flew there \"way\" for once, and it was 30 years ago.

First of all, their orbital period is a long time, Uranus takes 84 – it\'s almost like a person\'s life; and Neptune 164 years almost for two lifetimes! Just like this, man is the only one to have unlimited fantasy in which two planets.

It is estimated that those showing a blue-green is caused by massive amounts of methane in the atmosphere. At the time, when it recently just 81500 km from Uranus! And by the way found 10 new satellites of Uranus. Over the next four years, it also leaps of Neptune at close range. This is only one in human history and the close contact of the two planets.

And NASA is planning to return in the near future the two planets, and probe new tasks is to surround mode on the two planets to detect long-term, rather than simply a quick flyby. If this plan is implemented, human will complement the solar system currently known planets known deficiencies, also will be lots of groundwork for future space exploration.[Article correction][![Alt OtterBox Note 4](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/note4/otterbox_n4306_lrg.jpg)](http://www.awacase.com/otterbox-defender-galaxy-note-4-case-dark-jade-citron-green-p-10078.html)Collection is the collection of 1542Tags: astronomy\r Science and technology And anecdotes
