Now generally useful magnetic sensor and flux-gate processing electronic compass. Although the GPS navigation, positioning, velocity and orientation has a wide range of applications, but because of its signal by terrain and object blocking, precision is greatly reduced, cannot even use. Especially in built-up urban areas and lush forests, validity of the GPS signal is only 60%. And in the case of stationary, GPS will not give directional information. To make up for this shortfall, orientation and navigation methods can be used. Electronic compass products are designed to meet such needs. It can be effective compensation of the GPS signal, guarantees 100% effective navigation orientation information, even after the loss of GPS signal lock also works, to \"throwing stars are not lost.\"![Alt Quad-core known as the terminator?

The tool also includes a number of children, but we only take a total score, score higher then the higher degree of optimization of mobile phone browser, Web browsing experience better.④ Linpack test for Android[![Alt Hello Kitty Galaxy Note 3 case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/note3/hello_kitty_no103_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/hello-kitty-samsung-galaxy-note-3-case-black-p-4229.html)Is a test of the Linpack for Android Android Tablet CPU floating-point performance of the system performance test software. The software through the use of Gauss elimination method to solve an n times of dense linear algebra test to evaluate floating-point performance of the Android tablet. New versions of the Linpack performance test software for Android can be implemented at the request of high load operation full of calls to two processors in a dual-core Tablet purpose, to test the accuracy.Standby capacityLenovo K860i mobile phone with removable battery design, equipped with a 2250mAh battery, achieve mainstream standards.
