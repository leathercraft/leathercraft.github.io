![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/7839a935.jpeg)Editor\'s Note: Nubia Z5 now open to buy, although it came a bit late, but I believe that many users also are very interested in him. This is user maomaobear Z5 experience, from a unique perspective on the whole design and systems experience to evaluate Z5 performance.One, appearance and materialsThe Z5 \'s design style is very simple, as a result of fitting screen, the screen is all black, with silver metal sides, red circle breathing light. The results were pretty good, especially when charging or the phone, breathing light flashing black screen one, silver frame, metal buttons, a strong sense of design.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783ca9e2.jpeg) Brushed aluminum frame made of metal, and not vertical, but there is a slope, the following broad top narrow, stainless steel frame more than the iphone4 and 4S.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783cd66d.jpeg) (You can clearly see the border slope, narrow in width under bevel, and drawing of the metal border. ） Machine rear cover material was a little mean, get real before, look at the pictures thought it was a cheap plastic, but no pattern skid. But get real found no ordinary plastic, but a little rubber feel, softer friction coefficient is very high, so there is no pattern to slip, control of the texture is relatively good. Far from the ordinary hard plastic than.But do not touch but can not see it. Red circle behind the camera projection, display certain camera features. Behind the specific effect.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/7840ba22.jpeg)(Camera is outstanding, machine material may not look like much, but it really touched to know the feel and texture was good)S II, hardwareWhen Nubia Z5 is designed, hardware is the hat, 13 million cameras, 1080p screens, 8064 processor Qualcomm, 2G RAM. Got 5 months later now in addition to the processor is not up-to-date, other does not fall behind. [Fossil iPhone case](https://walletcase.wordpress.com/2015/04/08/intel-core-13-inch-projection-eyes-yoga-flat-2-pro-review/)Real rabbit run close to 20000 points, 8064 at normal levels, a variety of software is relatively smooth, the game isn\'t a problem. 1080p 5 inch screen quality is very good.13 million cameras to say a few words, 13 million cameras since the photographic area is small, more noise, but Nubia Z5 did a good job of noise, noise control, and no transition applied like Sony, that lost detail.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783346af.jpeg) (The camera in detail and adjustable balance between noise reduction and everyday shooting enough)dIn addition, the camera white balance is good, no mobile phone common color problems, population levels are not low. Many details under strong light, reflects the level of 13 million. City light is also good. And comes with the Advanced mode, metering and focus can be separated, if one can take advanced effects.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783e2def.jpeg) (Advance shooting mode, metering and focus can be separated, we note that photography and video is an independent press) Saying weakness was at night, which is a mobile phone problems, because its small size short exposure time, in light volume, if the pursuit of lightness, noise, noisy pursuit, screen is black. Nubia Z5 also adjusted the flowers. Solution only Nokia 920 and HTC one optical image stabilization force to increase the exposure time.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783b4ae4.jpeg) Nubia Z5 has a good design is three Netcom to eat, though they do not support TD, but three operators who can be inserted, users change mobile phone don\'t change operator, it is convenient. [FOSSIL iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/fossil-iphone-5-5s-case-stripes-p-3800.html)![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783a2800.jpeg) Needs special mention is Nubia Z5 metal frame and thermal design, this is quite interesting, to say a few words:1. ordinary Smartphone is now plastic back cover, half board, the fever mostly upper parts, because of the poor thermal conductivity of plastic, heat accumulation is faster, the temperature will be high, heat will be very slow. Samsung S4 runs three times, Tutu, can bring their own burn feature near the camera, but high temperatures will remain a relatively long period of time. Internal components for mobile is not a good thing. But the advantages of touch where the temperature is not high, does not affect the sense of control.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/783c2c13.jpeg) 2. an improved metal back cover, rear cover when the heat sink heat sink metal, graphite thermal conductive membrane chip heat to the metal cover. The advantage of this approach is cooling fast, does not accumulate heat. The electronic components inside the device is a protection. HTC ONE,OPPO Finder, the latest Lenovo K900, are designed this way. But the disadvantage of this design is that when heated up, control of cell phones can feel the temperature.![Alt \rSpring of 2016 Apple product launches](http://topincipio.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/7833604e.jpeg) 3. There is also a design is a chip in the battery heating, and hot chip are separated by a layer of cells, not high temperatures for a long time not to phone the fever. Comfort is better, but the problem is the accumulation of heat in the Interior, not only inside the device element is bad, the battery is not good. And really hot, cooling is slow, even slower than the first. Motorola RAZR 2 and millet are of this design. Millet 2 have the metal frame when the heatsink, but wrapped in plastic inside cooling effect watered down.(Millet to the metal frame at the same time cooling and shielding of the role, unfortunately, is a heavy plastic coated) Nubia Z5 is very interesting, falls somewhere in between the first and the second, Hot Chip at the top, but heat does not rely on plastic, but by a metal frame. Cooling speed is much faster than the first, because the metal border touch hands small and hot metal in the upper-right corner of the border, so quiet the cooling process is, you go to the whole touch mobile phone, don\'t know where the phone cooler.(Nubia Z5 is also all-metal frame heat sink, but the four edges of the metal framework is directly exposed to the air) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp7kcJ2ibU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyp7kcJ2ibU)  Between the sense of control and cooling speeds, between the first and second option, Nubia Z5 chose a compromise solution, actually worked well. Third, software[![Alt FOSSIL iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/iphone5/fossil_case_ip5901_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/fossil-iphone-5-5s-case-stripes-p-3800.html)Nubia Z5 software tune for a long time, the current version of a high degree.First of all, desktop Launcher slide very smoothly, without any feeling of stagnation or card. The processor frequency to maintain relatively low at this time.Secondly, the transition animation, click on the icon, open the program, switch interfaces, do the animation. While the animation itself cannot be said to be perfect, but has done animation to enhance the sense of flow. OPPO find5 is the most recent version before upgrading the animated transitions. Past Android looks better than IOS and the card is not the main reason the WP system transition animation. This is very important for smooth.Third, each interface to do the style, retain the native interface, is a large difference in the standard of small factory. Each application interface and built-in style, this Nubia is complete. This is you don\'t see at the zhongxing machine.Call interface or SMS interface, or the numeric keypad after dialing number, these are user experience. IOS when leading is these details well. NubiaZ5 in the detailed design, the overall style is black color, the pursuit of a sense of poise.(Set the graphic interface design, design note shading)s(Phone-dial interface design, small plants this is not design, Android is the blue button)d  (Comes with the visual style of the program pursue unification)d(The Visual effect of third-party programs, also made changes, and the overall style)dSystem Setup menu the background is not a solid color, but deliberately made the texture material, this is an excellent phone.(It can be noted that the background texture designs, buttons, textures and lighting design, which is fine) IV, deliberately design many humane function and purposefully designed a reasonable location Nubia Z5 phonebook card scan buttons, a demand-dial interface can send text messages, SMS interface can be directly searched, photographed and video camera interface keys side by side, without the Android system default interface switch. These little details are many.(Attention to the lower left corner of the dash key, call interface can directly send text messages) (Attention to the upper right corner of the business card scanning, contact interface can scan business cards directly)  (SMS interface can directly search the contents of text messages, contacts, very useful) Four, accessoriesNubia Z5 boxes are strong, open the tray da Lu Huo Yuan, the inside is a nice white box, there is a unified style of attachment. Box is very heavy, heavier materials like plastic but some texture is very good. Posted with two films, with headset, data cable, charger, Nubia are standard.dThis style of packaging before ZTE is invisible, Meizu and OPPO\'s all have unique design out of the box, Director of Nubia displayed another style. Five, the General evaluation and improvement of the localProducts are generally good, but not perfect. Annexes human and software details also there is some room for improvement, to be fixed in subsequent releases.Overall, Nubia Z5 reflected awareness of quality, attention to detail. Lexus from Toyota, is not technically what is the difference between the two, but the excellence of details on user comfort. The smoothness of the engine, gearbox frustrated sense of suspension comfort and noise insulation, seats comfortable. Not Mars high-tech, but thoughtful, detail. Nubia on the road. Learn more about the new cool device, please pay attention to @ love machine Related links:Empire Galaxy S4 \"4+4 nucleus\" full version evaluationGalaxy S4 Gemini I9500 VS I9505 rewardsGalaxy S4 research on internal structures and chipsHow to view Xiao long 600 \"Constitution\"?\"Super\" in?
