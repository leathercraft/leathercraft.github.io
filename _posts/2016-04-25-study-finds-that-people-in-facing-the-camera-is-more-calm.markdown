But when the respondents believe that the system is automatically controlled by the computer, the system cannot speak to the respondents authenticity make the right judgments.

To this end, Netherlands Twente University researchers developed the virtual about answering machine \"automatic question answering system\" the system through virtual avatar on the screen \"Brad\" interviews with the respondents, and through a series of sensors of the respondents Physiology and behavior changes to determine the authenticity of statements respondents.　　\"Brad\" asking each questions respondents. Researchers told some of the respondents answer, while other respondents to lie constantly during the interview process. During the interview, by respondents from the Electrodermal activity (EDA) were measured in order to determine whether the respondents are lying. Through the acquisition of 79 respondents found that only when respondents believe that \"Brad\" is controlled by hand, machine polygraph results are consistent with the actual situation.　　The researchers stressed, when respondents said that \"Brad\" is controlled by the computer, the system will not be able to judge whether it is telling the truth or lying.
