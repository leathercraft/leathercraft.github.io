Imagine you drive through the blue of the beach, can\'t help thinking to myself, if you have the opportunity to swim here, are also excellent. Suddenly, automatically rotate your steering wheel all of a sudden, too late to do any reaction, you swim in the blue sea of dreams have been realized with cars.It\'s not because you bought a car that \"mind-reading\" car. You are likely to provoke an automotive hacker.The world\'s most famous car hacking, than two of the following: Chali·mile and kelisi·walasaike.![Alt BlackHat topics | Painting bloody hackers at high speeds the car to swerve](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8433/28693036421_f8b709d8ff_z.jpg)\"Chali·mile and kelisi·walasaike\"They had on the BlackHat USA in 2015, the world\'s top hackers party staged a car break show shocked the world. In that speech, they demonstrated the remote penetration of Jeep vehicle system, a variety of functions on the remote-control car, including speed, turn off the engine, brake or brake failure. Such awesome play put the world in a State of shock.The crack directly led to the production of Chrysler Jeep recall 1.4 million cars in the world with a market value of instant evaporation of $ 40 billion. There is no doubt that Chrysler sees the two hackers hate can\'t take her teeth broken.Chrysler employees worldwide busy for six months as a whole, managed to fire over. They heard a message: the two hackers BlackHat 2016 will return, they will use a new method to hack a car, the car, and, Yes, J,e,e,p. \"No love\" says Chrysler is probably this.![Alt BlackHat topics | Painting bloody hackers at high speeds the car to swerve](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8669/28485826840_d30ac52010_b.jpg)\"Chali·mile and kelisi·walasaike in the BlackHat 2016\"Painting bloody \"high speed steering\"Abused many times Jeep \"cowardly chicken\", this time with a new \"scar\". One of the most scary, this is a \"controlled steering at high speed.\" While Charlie and Chris have implemented on this car last year \"to\" attack, but which has a lot of limitations, of which the most important is: the car must be traveling at very low speeds. Very low speed, generally less than 15 km/h. This is because hackers took advantage of automatic car parking system has made control of the steering wheel.There is no doubt that at low speeds, even hacked suddenly turned the steering wheel of the car, drivers also have enough time to correct direction, only minor scratches. Once at high speeds the steering wheel suddenly shake ... (I know what your brain make up the picture)http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTY3MTc2NTY5Mg(Stamp link to see video) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGOVM-FtmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGOVM-FtmE) Two hackers introduced automobile steering at a high speed, you need two key steps:1, \"co-opting\" engine control module (Engine Control Unit ECU for short). ECU quick and CAN bus of the vehicle (CAN-bus is the car\'s central nervous system, responsible for the collection and compilation of information) the exchange of information, tell it when the steering wheel could be controlled.2, trick steering wheel. In 2015, they do not solve the problem, in a State of high speed, the steering wheel will automatically ignore control commands from the CAN bus. Today, however, they finally found a loophole could hoodwink the processing logic on the steering wheel, were mistaken for car by steering wheel at low speeds.At this point, you\'re done, we take a look at the two hackers at the scene playing \"child abuse\" video scene.http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTY3MTc1ODgxMg(Stamp link to see video)[![Alt Ted Baker iPhone 6 Plus](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6plus/ted_baker_i6p1209_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-iphone-6-plus-case-tanalia-oil-blossom-p-4468.html)Another position, one more time.http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTY3MTc1ODUwMAFeet of clayDon\'t panic, don\'t rush to find Chrysler\'s return. Two hackers admit that this attack is far better than that of last year violent:In fact, we do not have remote attack like last year. We must be connected to the car\'s computer control interface in order to perform such operations.This is very important, and believe there won\'t be any one person seeing a stranger sitting on the passenger side with a computer attached to the line to go, ignore the car as usual ...In fact, long before Charlie and Chris to BlackHat, has posted on Twitter for the latest research results. And covered with cold sweat Chrysler has carefully studied their \"latest results\", the long breath, released the following statement:![Alt BlackHat topics | Painting bloody hackers at high speeds the car to swerve](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8340/28152601244_2da5eb2771_z.jpg)\"Chrysler\'s statement\"Statement is very long, but the core message was simple:I agree that these two guys pick out the mouth, but I have evidence that they were playing that game simply cannot achieve a remote attack. (I don\'t recall NND. ）However, Charlie and Chris both Uber employees are not being sent to all Chrysler, they are generous enough to put Chrysler and a horse. (Perhaps hold zoom down with Chrysler next year unknown) they most enjoyed, or when you break your car happy and full of base.

Finally, the street corn farmers to help them out of the car. (Of course, received a $ 10 consumption).Charlie and Chris for hackers to see them receive a bunch of tickets when the research car-cracking. For them, these tickets, it is the ticket to freedom.
