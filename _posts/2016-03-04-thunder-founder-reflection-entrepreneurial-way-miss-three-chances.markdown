Editor\'s Note: the writer @ Oscar Cheng, Thunder co-founder. Thunder has now embarked on a new frontier, and this article is his Thunderbolt in the history of lost opportunities for reflection. Network of Lei Feng Li Chen former summary: former Thunderbolt Member Director of operations: the four things I do in Thunderbolt hit, these two articles might be able to give you a better understanding of the development of Thunder.![Alt Thunder founder reflection: entrepreneurial way miss three chances](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1657/24838282314_ca1fa54294_b.jpg)Media should be invited, let me talk to a thunderbolt entrepreneurial experiences over the years. Frankly, feeling a lot, but don\'t know where to start, this decade not only appreciate the hardships of early start, also has made the joy of success, had older brothers left dejected, and regrets of missed opportunities.Until now, Thunder finally from the download into the area--this is a new way to share economic innovation CDN market. But any success to stand on the shoulders of countless failures, so I would like to first talk to you about missed opportunity in Thunder history.I am the end of 2002 from Baidu and a Duke classmate Zou shenglong founded the Thunderbolt, first-year distributed mailboxes, then transition to a thunderbolt. From 2003-2006, we are very focused, only one product line, by 2007 when the thunder from the data in the client software, users have only QQ. Thunder on the strategy to do after many attempts today, regrettably missed some opportunities.First but chances are the browser. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGOVM-FtmE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeGOVM-FtmE) Thunderbolt browser is still relatively early in the industry, there are some third-party browser already on the market, such as Maxthon. But the user base is small, 360, also just started doing.While browser can bring a lot of search revenues the business model was already clear, but the Thunder to do browser, the primary objective is not to make money. Core because we consider that the browser is to download the entrance, entrance, if seized by a third party, our core business is under heavy pressure.[![Alt Ted Baker iPhone](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/apple_case/ted_baker_ip824_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-iphone-5s-case-dog-p-3502.html)So we start the browser. Regret is that the final product did not release because we ourselves do not good enough, plus some relationships and 360, and there would be no promote. Then we put the browser\'s strategic and commercial interests more clearly when, again discussing whether to restart the project, but time has passed, and then into the Red Sea was not a sensible approach, it is we missed the first big opportunity.Second chance is streaming media.I remember very well, when potatoes first published that year, and we have very clear feeling from downloads to streaming video consumption trends. We specialize in organizing a strategy meeting, 20 or so top Dongguan closed for two days, and finally decided to start the Thunder. Thunderbolt is video brutal phase of the growth of the previous two years, the weekly data are a welcome change. But when the field matures when video essence and core competitiveness of business into the media, content and sales, and Thunderbolt technology genes are very different. When a business from the company\'s core competencies, result also doomed, like Tencent\'s genes are social, if you do a search, the result is predictable.Even if it is out of scope of our advantages, of course, we still have a chance. I have made repeated reflection and deduction, if we can start all over again, we are more sensible approach is to capture this trend, the Thunderbolt to split up, looking for the best CEO in the country, independent financing and managerial ownership, another startup. The flow and technical support to the Center, this is the chance. Split is another big topic for enterprises, enterprises should be bigger or are \"small\", and how \"small\", I will separate again. [Ted Baker iPhone](http://www.nodcase.com/ted-baker-iphone-5s-case-dog-p-3502.html)Third largest opportunity most regrettable is that opportunities for mobile application stores, because Thunder was born should be on the phone app store.Back in 2010-2011, Android had just begun, although there are 91, pea pods, such as Android market, but are not large in scale. So we made our own store, but frankly, we had to market this opportunity is not too clear, basically holding a try, neither put superior resources, nor from the point of view give adequate attention to the whole company. So when we feel that the experience is not good enough, and when some user complaints, coupled with some pressure we were the main business, basically this project has run aground. A year later, when we see more clearly when we invested heavily to restart the project, but at that time is already in the Red Sea, 360 mobile phone Assistant is already large, Baidu and Tencent are beginning to focus on investment, once the window of opportunity is lost, no, we try for six months and finally gave up.I often reflect on these years, why some of the most significant opportunities we missed? Here is how I summarize some thoughts, hope to start-up of some friends on the way to help.1, deep thinking and avoid \"strategy and tactics\".To the center of the browser and app store, for example, we are not done, but not invested heavily, not insist on doing, is thinking small led to discord did not see well. After think deeply if we think this is a must do and must to be successful, then, projects started will focus all the resources, the project encountered difficulties even substitutions on the difficulties. To do this, it must be \"strategic.\"Because \"not clear on the strategy, tactics are absolutely impossible to surprise you with\" strategic value determines whether you Allin on your resources.The app can do, it is not a surprise for Ma, because it is too important for Tencent, do several teams at the same time. If Zhang Xiaolong made up, that\'s what Bruce Lee or Wang Xiaolong, in short, have to have one made up for me. Allin was not possible so there is no in-depth thinking attitude, business has no \"surprise\" or \"four-two ounces\", all based on logic, based on your strategy, and the strategy behind the number input.2, the greatest threats are not competitors, but a trend.The Internet, a wave a few years, there will be some \"radical changes\", so \"sense of crisis\" is the norm. 360 desktop security field, Baidu is still in search of absolute monopoly, but the wireless trend this wave came, this is both an opportunity and challenge for all enterprises, either up or down, catch is opportunity, or be challenged.360 software is represented by millet as a tool of domestic handset manufacturers \"hard one\" challenge Baidu the wireless era \"connects people and information\" by \"the information, services, payment of\" end-to-end integration app challenge. Tencent micro-letter if not caught this opportunity, now even the $ 50 billion market value is not necessarily there. Even now seize the opportunities of the Internet, the face of the next wave of opportunity, reshaping the entire business chain such as artificial intelligence, it\'s difficult to predict what BAT would be, so to Evergreen enterprises must seize a \"radical change\" brought about by the opportunity. [Ted Baker iPhone 5](https://moschino9.wordpress.com/2015/12/11/new-1-billion-dollar-unicorn-company-is-what/)\"Sense of crisis\" is the norm, \"from the death of XX days\" is not a very exaggerated, not only on startup, the BAT is the same.3, business model innovation, and innovation is equally important.Itself back to the Thunder, Thunder is longer than technological innovation, P2SP content transfer algorithm was invented and first used for practical applications, while Thunder first also P2SP applications in the field of streaming media on-demand, for nearly a year and we get through all the superior way to subvert the CDN, said Xunlei is Chinese relatively less technological innovation company. But innovation alone is not enough, business model innovation is equally important. Microsoft or Google or their great not just because they have a NB technology innovation, but also because they create a new business model. While bringing tremendous value to users, but also provide enormous commercial benefits to the enterprise. How to improve business agility, business model innovation, for many technology-oriented companies, \"learning\" is very critical.Catching opportunities in any enterprise in the development process, and also missed some opportunities, it is normal, only learning in reflection, in frustrations continue to grow, to make a business in \"evergreen\" go farther on the road. I write this with Thunder colleagues share.\"The author of\" Oscar Cheng, Thunder co-founder.
