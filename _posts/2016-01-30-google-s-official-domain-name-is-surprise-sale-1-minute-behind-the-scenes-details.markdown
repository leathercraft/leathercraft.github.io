Lucky is that accidentally bought the domain name Sanmay Ved is an experienced \"flours\" (and a former employee), and after the event for the first time to inform Google security team canceled the deal.[![Alt DKNY iPhone plus case]([[3, u\'http://resource.feng.com/resource/h060/h90/img201601292137020.jpg\', \'Google\\\'s official domain name is \"surprise sale 1 minute\" behind the scenes details\', \'https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1498/24597996781_a04d3cb13b_z.jpg\']])](http://www.nodcase.com/dkny-iphone-6-plus-case-rose-p-4998.html)　　Earlier reports said Google will \"find\" issuing \"over $ 10,000\" bonus. But until Thursday, Google to disclose in detail the total number of reward Ved.Sanmay Ved on the LinkedIn data is rather \"Google fan\".
