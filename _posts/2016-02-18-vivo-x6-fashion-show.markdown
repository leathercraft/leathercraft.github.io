![Alt \rVivo X6 fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1632/24997542081_8d5066b61b_b.jpg)We often see in the mobile phone hardware parameters of the \"video 1920*1080,30 frames per second\" such data, then one of the \"30 fps\" what does it mean? Let us know below frame concept.[![Alt Michael Kors iphone](http://www.nixcase.com/images/large/iphone5/michael_kors_ip4009_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nixcase.com/michael-kors-iphone-5-case-cover-frost-purple-p-3390.html) Frame number is the amount of pictures in 1 second of time transfer, can also be understood as the graphics processor to refresh a few times per second, usually with FPS (Frames Per Second). Each frame is a still image, to display frames in rapid succession creates the illusion of movement. Higher frame rates can be more fluid, more realistic animations. Number of frames per second (FPS), the more the action will display more smoothly. But the file size will be larger.(The above is taken from Baidu encyclopedia) So we see the parameters in the \"30 fps\" is that \"a second time, take 30 static pictures, and then connect it by playing\" because human Visual residue characteristics: is light on the retina produced by Visual light after exposure to stop still for a period of time, was a result of neurons in response. Reaction rate is one-twenty fourth seconds (that play static images more than 24 frames per second, the human eye seems to be smooth and continuous dynamic picture without Caton). Is a form of animation, film and other visual media and communications under which Japan relax TV animation most uses 18 frames per second to produce, while the United States animation is 24 frames per second of the conscience. In regards to the film and many other film and television work in order to have a better picture of smooth is generally applied to 30 frames or more. In contrast to the phone, because machine handling picture impact of power and storage capacity, most mobile video recording capabilities of both 720P and 1080P are only 30 frames a second.

But this is a good start, at least manufacturers pay more attention to people\'s demand for high-speed video, although this is not very much in demand, but at least ... ...You may think high speed video in addition to make video look better without. In fact, we see a lot of slow playback video was taken down by high speed video and then frames slow playback by software, can be shown in slow motion video.Above small series said \"eye in see over 24 frame each seconds of static pictures on will think is continuous dynamic video\", so you can shooting to 60 frame each seconds of video, then through software put each seconds frame number regulation to 24 frame around, so you in a seconds within shooting to of image on can through slow speed play into two seconds, and is continuous of, and not Caton of. If you can shoot 90 frames per second video, then you can at least slow down a second to three seconds of slow motion playback, and so on. High-speed video shoot to a lot of us tend to ignore the details and brilliant moments, through the slow-motion video, also makes video more fun and interesting, and this is why more and more companies began to focus on high-speed video recording function of the reasons.Currently this feature is not very mature, and hope that in the future the development of hardware to make this feature more mature, so don\'t say, \"excess hardware\" comment. Smartphone functions and software development, will only make their increasing demand for the mobile phone hardware.  [Michael Kors iphone](http://www.nixcase.com/michael-kors-iphone-5-case-cover-frost-purple-p-3390.html)Links to related articles:Popular science: the absolute golden ratio photography guidesPopular science: Golden spiralPopular science: c bisector of the role of camera?Why flash photography photography science felinesAbout mobile ISO, Aperture and shutter speed that something ![Alt \rVivo X6 fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1461/24972723042_dd3e7e0264_b.jpg)![Alt \rVivo X6 fashion show](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1601/24795289820_d8960b176d.jpg)2190 votesMicrosoft Surface 3\rNew atom performance ARM processors have and top closer, but are worse and the mainstream core of the series by a mile, but taking into account the thermal power of 14W and 2W gap, which is understandable.
