World Network: author James Zhu, you introduced in this paper 1) quantum computer history; 2) advantage of quantum computers than traditional computer; 3) quantum algorithms and our relationship; 4) IBM Service quantum online experience.Quantum computers really do not only exist in science fiction? It and general computer-what\'s the difference? What relationship do the procedure in and I. This article totalitarian unknown Jue Li, hope you find a quantum computer!Back in 2001, IBM released an article saying that \"in the next couple of decades, quantum computer is likely to be out of the science fiction and scientific research laboratories (mainly in the IBM) applied to practice. ”This phrase has now become a reality, and only spent more than 10 years \' time. On Wednesday, IBM scientists will for the first time the company\'s quantum computer access cloud services to the general public. Development of science and technology was always shocked. And IBM hope to be developed within a few years is available in experimental quantum computer chip. At present, IBM has not officially announced the quantum computing services, interested friends can log on IBM applications for Quantum trial.IBM is working on is based on the effect of superconducting quantum logic gate structure of universal quantum computer. For a quantum computer, reproduced many of the domestic media reported, but most of the basic level stays in the translation of the English-language press. And forward to each other, there is little original or similar electronic product trial evaluation. Author who happens to do quantum cryptography research and experiments for quantum computing are also interested, and author of one of the Photonics (Photonics) also happens to one of quantum encryption/physical realization of quantum computation.So we are contributing an article from shallow to deep, eye-opening introduction to the science, give you the explanation principles of quantum computers, the difference between normal computer and, with our programmers have to do, and the authors also use IBM\'s services to do some testing. Hope no professional background readers a glimpse of the whole picture from this article, as well as with relevant background information (mainly physics, quantum and digital/analog circuits) readers could be gained.The invention of quantum computer historyShidifen·weisina in 1969, the first \"computing devices based on quantum mechanics\". 1980 a series of study on theory of quantum computers become plentiful. In May 1981, physics and computer science in MIT\'s meeting, was born in 1918 United States physicist Richard Feynman, has made a \"Simulating Physics With Computers\" report, opened a new chapter in the research and development of quantum computers.Feynman proposed in the report: a classical Turing machine can be simulated by quantum physics? The answer is no, with traditional computer simulation of quantum mechanics, computational systems (particle number) increases exponentially. Feynman considered microcosm is the essence of quantum, attempted to mimic it, and nature works the same way, which is quantum mechanically. Feynman\'s first theory of physics and computer linked with his brilliant speech at the MIT, computer scientists began to focus on the progress of physics, focusing on quantum mechanics.In 1994, Bell Labs expert bide·xiuer (Peter Shor) that quantum computers can make the discrete logarithm computing, and much faster than traditional computers.On May 11, 2011, the Canada D-Wave Systems has released a so-called \"world\'s first commercial quantum computer\" computing devices \"D-Wave One\".In May 2013, Google and NASA in Californian quantum release D-Wave Two artificial intelligence laboratory.What is quantum computingQuantum computer is a theoretical science. It is the study of how to direct use of quantum mechanics phenomena (such as quantum superposition and entanglement) to manipulate data and calculation system of science. On the final results, Quanta computer and existing computers are no different (otherwise, there must be one is wrong, there isn\'t anything wrong side had no practical value). Their biggest difference is that the operation is a far cry from the process, will explain in detail later.Quantum computing model, there are 3 main types:Quantum circuit modelOne-way quantum computation modelAdiabatic quantum computation model1. the quantum circuit modelQuantum circuit model (Quantum circuit model) is a classic calculation calculation of quantum imaging as a different \"logic gates\" (of course is a quantum operation) acting on quantum States, and finally the desired quantum state.2. one-way quantum computation model  One-way quantum computing model (one-way quantum computation model) is the quantum computation, formed by the transport (teleportatio) and the measurement of two-dimensional cluster state (two dimensional cluster state), quantum gate operations allows us to get what we want (quantum gates).3. adiabatic quantum computation modelAdiabatic quantum computation model (adiabatic quantum computation model) are classified into complex problems of ground state of Hamilton (Hamiltonian ground state) questions (that is, find the ground state can find the end result), and then started with a simple amount of Hamilton, through ground state of adiabatic process and finally get what you need.Where is the quantum computer is superior to traditional computer?Fabricated quantum computers still need good algorithms. Like scheduling problems in our everyday use of computers, writing good algorithms can be done in o (n*log (n)) time complexity, which the algorithm is o (n^2).Take a very practical example: Fast Fourier transform (FFT) in signal processing and image processing is a very common and very useful functions. Its time complexity is o (n*long (n)). With quantum computers, complexity of FFT can be reduced to o ((log (n)) ^2), and even read the data of o (n) time is not as long as log (n) a qubit can describe n-dimensional vectors. Use of high-performance FFT, complexity can be achieved index for factoring (sub-exponential time).Quantum computer currently has in a scalable manner, using the Shor\'s Algorithm to complete the 15 Prime decomposition. Someone said: prime factorization using Shor algorithms this thing could be with classical computers \"Hello World!\" par. In addition to marvel at its pioneering status, from one side the current quantum computing is still in its infancy stage.Quantum algorithms and what relationship do we have? Quantum algorithms complexity and great relationships in your data:Described above, interested readers should already know by heart: the larger the amount of data, quantum advantage on the time complexity of the algorithm is more obvious: when n=1000, o (n^2) the traditional algorithm requires computing 1 million steps, o (n*log (n)) a little bit better, they have thousands of steps. Quantum computation takes only a few steps to complete the operation to get the final result.In the age of big data, n=10000000 is the norm, then top the contrast becomes 10^12 vs 10^6 vs 10^2, the time gap between is several orders of magnitude.Simply based on FFT for example above, once you find practical algorithms can actually achieve o (n) or o (1) the efficiency of that data in the field can put an end to conventional computers.Programmers understand quantum algorithms, and the now familiar deep learning algorithms and data structures programmers, become particularly sought after.So now to invest the necessary time and effort to learn a little knowledge of quantum computation, is a good choice for self-improvement. Quantum experience IBM Web site, also provides the platform and opportunity.Relationship between cloud computing and quantum algorithms complexity:Quantum algorithm for cloud storage industry, you will hit. Currently capable of big government are quiet study on quantum computing in order to solve important encrypted files. And as long as the technology is available, then any data stored in third-party cloud had become unsafe. Because even if it is stored encrypted, in the blink of an eye was also cracked.Quantum computing threats, users will be more conservative save sensitive data only has access to the physical environment, rather than careless encrypted upload to third-party cloud storage service providers. Of course, quantum computing will also drive the development of encryption technology. But now the spear and shield of the contest, under the influence of government agencies, is supposed to decrypt technologies prevail and more easily into civilian use. Quantum Cryptography is mainly Government agencies. So from the point of view, the emergence of quantum computation, to offer cloud storage service industry is not a good news. Of course, as a programmer, if quantum encryption algorithm can understand and even design, may soon become the IT industry\'s hottest hot spicy chicken, even by government agents to kill is not impossible.

In its current design, at least be able to handle hundreds of quantum bit (qubit) makes sense, IBM is now open 5-qubit computing services are far closer to this goal. Universal quantum computer can refer to the specific indicators of The Physical Implementation of Quantum Computation (http://arXiv.org/ABS/quant-ph?0002077)Specific physical implementation has a lot of hardware, such as:PhotonicsNuclear magnetic resonanceCavity QEDQuantum dot● Redberg atom● ion trap● Josephson junctionAnd so on to achieve.Compared with the D-wave quantum computer, IBM where is the cow?Famous D-wave generation 1 and generation 2 using Josephson junction.NASA, CIA, Google purchased D-wave for related research. University of Oxford and luokemading, Nokia has built a quantum based on D-wave model of artificial intelligence research center. D-Wave is questioned because of its limited scenario, the current design is not a universal quantum computer.IBM is developing is a universal quantum computer based on quantum logic gates, so versatility is no problem, all the quantum algorithm can be run.In addition, IBM had two very important breakthrough.A simultaneous detection of two quantum error (quantum errors): 1. bit-flip, 2. phase-flip。 Which greatly enhanced the stability of the computer.The simplest single qubit Dirac said: | Psi>=a|0>+b|1>, where a,b is the coefficient of two ground state. Other ground state quantum bits are |+> and |->, |spin+> and |spin->. May also be denoted | Psi>=a|+>+b|-> or | Psi>=a|spin+>+b|spin->, orthogonal basis to be adopted depends largely on the physical realization of quantum systems, such as photons, particles of spin polarization State, is no longer here.A standard orthogonal qubits are two bits 0 and 1 of the arbitrary stacking. A and b satisfy the normalization condition, so a and b there is a phase between degrees of freedom. If phase in the process of quantum computing is disturbed, the flip is is phase-flip. Bit-flip is 0 accidents during the operation the operation becomes 1, or 1 accident becomes 0. Ideally, quantum computing does not have errors. But because of the ambient noise (mainly heat and electromagnetic radiation), quantum systems will be subject to environmental interference. Only in the environment of zero-field strong and absolute zero, can there be an ideal state of quantum computing. D-wave is in 20mk (lingxia273.13du), IBM used a superconducting chip operating temperature is 15mk (lingxia273.135du, only 0.015 degree above absolute zero-273.15 degrees).Before research can only measure one of two error, can not do EC (error correction). Now IBM has solved this problem (http://spectrum.IEEE.org/tech-talk/computing/hardware/IBM-shows-first-full-error-detection-for-quantum-computers).Second, IBM provides the greatest scalability. New development should be implemented in actual hardware problem. IBM the next goal should be added to the 50 to 100 quantum bits. Then we need more resources in research and development.Clarify that came with a lot of media here universal misunderstanding of quantum bits, as well as jointly and severally liable to misunderstanding of quantum computing: advantages of quantum computation, interpretation is common in the media, compared with common computer uses 0, 12 binary values, each quantum bit of quantum computer can store information between 0 and 1. It is a mere assumption to explain, this is not the essence of quantum computers advantages:Because obviously we are characterized by analog circuit composed of resistors capacitors can be any value between 0 and 1. So essentially different from not the bit values carried by the endless possibilities, but bits of quantum superposition characteristics. For multiple-bit operation, Quanta computer\'s advantages are evident: all the bits to be completed at the logic, which is the traditional computers can\'t do it to.For a bit of quantum systems, qubit State of the system as a whole is forecast, which is the single qubit cannot be determined.Take a simple example to explain this associated superposition of quantum States – is also used in the IBM course that quantum computing services to the Hadamard Gate is common:Hadamard Gate is to input 0|0 ⟩ α + α 1|1 ⟩, into the output 2^{-1/2} (α-0+ α 1) |0 ⟩ +2^{-1/2} (Alpha alpha 0-1) |1 ⟩. In other words, the Hadamard Gate is the classic example of a State |0 ⟩ and converting |1 ⟩ |0 and |1 ⟩ ⟩ \"halfway\".Key is: this action, even if it is only the first n qubits are Hadamard gate operations, all 2^{n} a factor will change. Here the \"parallel\" operation is the physical nature of quantum mechanics to ensure that, rather than uninformed media multiple nuclear devices of \"parallel/multithreaded\".Must be \"cold\", quantum computersBack to IBM quantum computing lab hardware, the following two screenshots of the videos from the official website:Figure open dilution refrigerator (open dilution refrigerator).

After all this physical model correspond to the optical interference, look extra special.Introduction to Deutsch-Jozsa AlgorithmDeutsch-Jozsa was the first to prove that quantum algorithms quantum algorithms to circumvent the classical example is in trouble. Shows this algorithm allows the quantum amplitude of positive and negative, rather than the traditional probabilities must always be non-negative.Deutsch-Jozsa quantum issues is defined as follows. Consider a function f (x) on the input of n bits x return 0 or 1.If we ensure that f (x), or is a constant function, whose return values are constants c and c ∈ {0,1} on all input x, or f (x) is the balancing function, for any input he took half the 0,1 value. Our goal is to try as little as possible to determine f (x) function is constant or balanced function. Traditional algorithms in the worst case needs to be 2^ (n-1) + 1 times. Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithm used, this question can be answered with only one operation. [Cath Kidston iPhone plus case](http://www.mkfans.com/cath-kidston-iphone-6-plus-case-rose-yellow-p-4262.html)To understand how Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms work, let us first consider a typical experiment: behave like particles, such as photons, detector arrays from the source by two or more paths. Probability large areas observed particles are incident on arrival area with the same phase.Imagine that we can build a test, has a 2^n-detector and from the source to the 2^n a possible path for each detector. We labeled n-bit input x and y of n-bit detector. Suppose further that x and detector ý accumulated along the path is equal to the phase c ( -1) ^ (f (x) +x+y), whichx⋅y=Σi= xiyiIs the inner product of binary (dot), c is a normalization factor. Observations of particles in the detector y probability of all paths by adding up the amplitude of the square of the absolute value of x when y is reached is calculated:PR(y)= | CΣx(-1)^(f(x)+x⋅y)| ^2Normalized condition σ yPr (y) = 1, and c = 2^ (-n). Next calculate the detector y = 0^N observation on the probability of the particle spectrum (y = 0^n) (all zeroes). We have Pr (y = 0^n) = | 2^(-n)Σ(-1)f(x)|^ 2If the function f (x) = c is a constant, we obtain Pr (Yy= 0^n) = | ( -1) ^c |^ 2 = 1. And when f (x) is a function of balance, we\'re going to get Pr (y = 0^n) = 0, because all the sum of more than x cancel each other out.Therefore, we can only use an experiment to determine whether f (x) function is constant or balanced. []() ![Alt Treating unknown Jue LI: IBM black depth decryption technology quantum computer](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5742/30303952045_482e2e9b7d_z.jpg)Of course, this experiment by optical means less practical because it requires a very large optical platform! However, we can use quantum computer simulation experiment using only n-qubit and access Oracle means Uf will be able to implement.In fact, consider using the following algorithm:1th: initialize the all-zero state of n qubits | 0,...,0>.2nd step Hagamard door h to each qubit.The 3rd step. Oracle application circuit for Uf.4th step: repeat step 2.5th step: measure each qubit. Set y = (Y1,...,yn) is a list of results.If f is a constant function, then y will be observed is the null string. Hagamard keeper uniform superposition of |0> and entering |0> maps to |1>. State of the system after the second step is 2^ (-n/2) σ |x>.Then Oracle circuit map this status to 2^ (-n/2), σ ( -1) ^f (x) |x>. 4th step apply the Hadamards again, it maps the ground state |x> to a superposition of 2^ (-n/2), σ ( -1) ^ (XY) |y>. Finished State of the system is the 4th step | ψ >= ψ σ (y) |y>, where ψ (y) = 2^ (-n) σ ( -1) ^ (f (x) + x ⋅ y).This is exactly what we need to test.In step 5 of the role measurement plays a test particle. As above results show that if the probability y=0^n value is 1, then f is a constant function. Is zero, then f is a function of balance. We therefore only an operation would solve the Deutsch-Jozsa exact solutions of quantum problems.Quantum circuit designJump things up so much, without quantum mechanics based readers may feel dizzy.

What IBM did is right. The service interface is easy to use, \"any student to understand quantum computers know how to interact with the devices. ”Cory weekend trial the IBM of this new service, and to his surprise is this: the system fairly stable – each test it was almost the same results. This is a common phenomenon in traditional computers, but are basically centred on acquisition probability of quantum computers in the world, and consistent means of marking progress. ”IBM did use his quantum computing platform proved one of his breakthroughs: the pair of simultaneous measurement error to greatly improve the stability of the system. In addition to the platform is open to the public 5qubit, also gave us the space of imagination--IBM can in the short term advances the qubit to how many bits?Summary:IBM provides the platform, looked for their own research and development results and corporate brand advertising, advertise fact does play a role.But if you really think that there is only so much information, that means you don\'t have to try on a Web page of quantum computation and algorithms.If you try, it is not difficult to find, IBM provides is a platform for two-way learning: try from which the user can learn the basic quantum computing knowledge and common algorithm from IBM can approximate cognitive level of statistical users.Since each user is registered with the email, and playing with a lot on the platform.
